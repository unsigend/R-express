# Web-Pack

A simplified rebuild of web frameworks like Express.js and React using modern JavaScript features. This project recreates core functionality in a minimalist way for architecture study and source code learning.

Web-Pack strips away production complexity to expose fundamental concepts and patterns. It serves as an resource for understanding how web frameworks work under the hood.

Note: It only focuses on core features and architectural learning rather than security, performance, or robustness.
